About the video:
Hans Rosling shows that income and health go hand in hand. People live longer in richer countries. Or the other way around. Countries are richer where people live longer. There are no high income countries with a short life expectancy, and no low income countries with a long life expectancy. Still, there’s a huge difference in life expectancy between countries on the same income level, depending on how the money is distributed and how it is used. This video is freely available to
