Smallest infinity
Natural numbers & co
Infinity is the embodiment of the notion of something extending forever and ever.
Like the infinite love being sung about in pop songs.
Mathematical infinity can be just as romantic and confusing.
Let’s try to understand a little bit more about that.
With finite things, we’re used to having quantities of things that can be counted and compared.
A box of 10 cats clearly has more cats than a box of 5 cats.
Two boxes of 10 cats each have the same number of cats.
We can try to extend this logic to infinite sets (collections) of things.
Let our ‘things’ be all the
natural numbers
N
, numbers that you can count with, like 1, 2, 3, 4…,
and all the squares of natural numbers
N
2
, like 1, 4, 9, 16…
They are both infinite as we can keep going forever, but there are clearly more numbers
in the former than the latter, right? For example, the numbers 5, 6, 7, 8 are all
missing from the latter. This intuition is, in fact, wrong. These two sets have the same “size”.
The XIX century mathematician Georg Cantor defined a means of measuring and comparing infinite sets,
according to which
sets of different elements can be compared by pairing them off
. If we can find a one-to-one pairing
between two sets, we say that they have the same size, or
cardinality
.
This works quite simply for our cats example, by the way. We can show that the box
of 5 cats 🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈 has fewer cats than the one with 10 🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈 by taking out one cat at a time from
each box and pairing them together. Once we get to cat #6, there will still be
cats left in the first box but not in the second one. This way of
comparing sets works for infinite ones as well!
So all we need to do to show that two infinitely big sets are the
same size is to try and find a consistent pairing - one that will go on according to
the same rule forever and ever - between the elements of the first set and the elements of the second set.
Moreover, a set is
countably infinite
or
enumerable
if its elements
can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers
N
.
Let’s come back to our original question - Is the ‘size’
of
N
the same as the ‘size’ of
N
2
?

Take the first 100 natural numbers.
There are exactly 10 square numbers amongst these: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100.
Notice how squares get more sparse the further we go through the list. You might think that,
surely there are fewer squares than natural numbers.
But we’ll show that we can pair off the naturals and their squares in such a way that,
no matter how big a natural number you think of, you can always find a corresponding square.
Same-size infinities
Fractions are countably infinte, too.
Let’s do a more fun proof and this time take a set that seems to be larger than
the natural numbers and show that it also can be put in a 1-to-1 correspondence
with the naturals and hence is also of cardinality aleph 0. We’ll prove that the positive
rational numbers
Q
, or
numbers that can be expressed as a fraction,
such as 1/4, 33/3345, 2345/46, 1/3, 44/5, 5/4, are the same cardinality as the natural numbers
N
.
And so they are also enumerable.
Remember, we just need to find a recipe for pairing
Q
and
N
such that no matter
what fraction we take, we can always find a natural number that corresponds to it, and vice versa.
We owe the first rigorous proof of this also to Cantor 👏.

* We won’t go into the proof here, but it’s worth taking a few minutes to think about this yourself.
Here is a
brilliant video
that goes over the proof,
as well as other things we talked about.
The cardinality of the real numbers is called the
continuum (c)
and the statement that there is no cardinality between
that of the natural numbers and that of the reals is called
the
continuum hypothesis
. It
has been a crucial piece of standard set theory.

An even bigger infinity
Enter the real numbers.
After proving that
N
and
Q
have the same cardinality, Cantor went on to show that
the size of the natural numbers is strictly less than the size
of the
real numbers
R
. *
Let’s take a step back and talk about what goes inside the reals. We already know
that
R
contains all of the rationals
Q
,
whole numbers
Z
and natural numbers
N
.
But there is another interesting set, which can also be shown to be the same size as
N
, that
contains all these, and that’s the
algebraic numbers
A
.
Algebraic numbers are numbers which are solutions to algebraic equations - like the x of x
2
- 4x - 5 = 0 (The answer is x = -1 or 5, by the way).
Some
irrational numbers
- numbers
that can’t be expressed as the ratio of two integers, such as √2 - are algebraic, but others are not.
These are called
transcendental numbers
.
Some very important numbers are known to be transcendental - namely π (pi = 3.14159265...) and Euler's number e.
One way to think of these transcendental numbers is the “matter” than “fills” most of
R
and
makes an infinity-sized difference
between
R
and any of the other sets above. In other words, transcendental
numbers form pretty much all possible numbers 😱.
There are no real patterns and rules that govern the digits of transcendental numbers,
including π, though people have tried very hard to find them 👀.
Visualise the digits of π?
Many visualisations of digits of π exist.
Let’s try to invent one of our own, and see how we can use that to reason about the very special transcendental number π.
Ignore your intuition
Cubes with finite volume but infinite area?
Mathematics, especially the mathematics of infinity, does much more than describe the reality that you and I
experience every day. Let’s look at one example that might require suspension of disbelief.
It’s a geometrically simpler example similar to the mathematical curiosity called Gabriel’s
horn - a geometric figure that has infinite surface area but finite volume.
The apparent contradiction in this shape only occurs if you imagine it to be a real
life object and not a mathematical one.
1/√1
1/√2
1/√3
1/√4
1/√5
1/√6
1/√7
Construct the shape.
The geometric shape that we will look at is, in fact, an infinite series of cubes.
The first cube has all three dimensions (length l, width w, height h) equal to 1/√1.
The second one has them at 1/√2, the third at 1/√3 and so on.
We keep going forever, with the n
th
cube having dimensions of 1/√n.
Infinity in a fractal
The Mandelbrot set
Infinity appears all over the place.
Let’s take another leap of imagination and talk about
fractals
.
For our purposes, we can think of fractals as visualisations of mathematical
patterns/sets/rules that contain
fine and often (but not always) self-similar details
no matter how much we zoom into them, even infinitely.
It might not seem like it at first glance, but there is something in common between fractals
and the finite volume but infinite area cubes we looked at above.
Either all or some fractals, depending on whom you ask, essentially have a finite area
bounded by an infinite parameter.
The
Koch snowflake
is one simple such example - it is a
fractal shape that can easily be constructed from triangles with pen and paper but at
its limit, it will have finite area but infinite parameter.
The proof of that is actually along the same lines as our cubes above.
But let’s have a look at something cooler-looking.
What is the Mandelbrot Set?
The famous
Mandelbrot set
is defined as a set of
complex numbers
(think √-1 kind of numbers) that satisfy the conditions of a
relatively simple equation. When visualised in a certain way,
it produces fascinating
infinitely-zoomable fractal patterns
.
Mathematicians still debate (as far as I can tell) the “area” of the
Mandelbrot set but it is known to be finite, while its perimeter
grows to infinity with more and more detail.
