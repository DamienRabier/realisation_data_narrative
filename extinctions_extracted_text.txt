Animal species are going extinct anywhere from 100 to 1,000 times the rates that would be expected under natural conditions. According to Elizabeth Kolbert's
The Sixth Extinction
and other
recent
studies
, the increase results from a variety of human-caused effects including climate change, habitat destruction, and species displacement. Today's extinction rates rival those during the mass extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago.

MAMMALS
1,469 mammal species at risk
According to the natural extinction rate, we should not see more than one mammal species go extinct per century. Scientists predict 1,469 will likely go extinct in that time. Notice the red cluster around primates, especially lemurs. Rhinos, elephants, bears and big cats are also in trouble.

MAMMALS
Given the natural extinction rate, we would not expect more than one mammal species go extinct per century.
However according to the scientists, 1,469 are currently in danger of extinction in that time. Primates are highly at risk, especially the lemur family. Rhinos, bears, and big cats are also in trouble.
REPTILES
According to the natural extinction rate, we should not see more than one reptile extinction per century.
However, 1,163 are currently at risk for extinction in that time. Especially endangered groups include the order of turtles, as well as the chameleon
and iguana families.
AMPHIBIANS
According to the natural extinction rate, we should not see
more than one amphibian extinction per century. However, 2,341 are currently at risk
for extinction. Frogs have been hit hard, with families like the water frog,
shrub frog, and dancing frog in great danger.
BIRDS
According to the natural extinction rate, we should not see
more than one bird extinction per century. However, 2,200 are currently at risk for
extinction. Albatrosses, penguins, hornbills and parrots are particularly at risk.
