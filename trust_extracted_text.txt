During World War I, peace broke out.
It was Christmas 1914 on the Western Front.
Despite strict orders
not
to chillax with the enemy, British
and German soldiers left their trenches, crossed No Man's Land,
and gathered to bury their dead, exchange gifts, and play games.
Meanwhile: it's 2017, the West has been at peace for decades, and
wow, we
suck
at trust. Surveys show that, over the past forty years,
fewer and fewer people say they trust each other. So here's our puzzle:
Why, even in peacetime, do friends become enemies?
And why, even in wartime, do enemies become friends?
I think
game theory
can help explain our epidemic of distrust –
and how we can fix it! So, to understand all this...
...let's play a game. →

THE GAME OF TRUST
You have one choice.
In front of you is a machine: if you put a coin in the machine,
the
other player
gets three coins – and vice versa.
You both can either choose to COOPERATE (put in coin), or CHEAT (don't put in coin).
Let's say the other player cheats, and doesn't put in a coin.
What should you do?
Exactly! Why let that moocher mooch off of you?
Alas, turning the other cheek just gets you slapped!
If you cooperate & they cheat, you lose a coin while they gain three. (score: -1 vs +3)
However, if you both cheat, neither of you gain or lose anything. (score: 0 vs 0)
Therefore: you should CHEAT.
But let's say the other player cooperates, and puts in a coin.
What should you do now?
Wow, that's mean... and also the correct answer!
Sure, seems like the right thing to do...
OR IS IT??
Because if you both cooperate, you both give up a coin to gain three. (score: +2 vs +2)
But if you cheat & they cooperate, you gain three coins at their cost of one. (score: +3 vs -1)
Therefore: you "should" still CHEAT.
And
that's
our dilemma.
Trust is nice, but it can let others take advantage of you -- or shoot you as you come unarmed out of a trench.
Sometimes, distrust
is
rational!
But now, what happens if we play this game...
...more than once? →
Now, let's play for real.
You'll be playing against 5 different opponents, each with their own game "strategy".
With each opponent, you'll play anywhere between 3 to 7 rounds.
(You won't know in advance when the last round is)
Can you trust them? Or rather... can they trust
you?
Pick your first,
real
move.
Choose wisely.
opponent: [X] of [Y]
your total score:
And your total score is...
which is, wow, actually
impressively
bad.
which, uh, could be worse!
which ain't bad!
which is pretty good!
which is
perfect!
Congrats you have too much time on your hands.
...i have no idea how you did that.
(the lowest & highest possible scores are 7 and 49, respectively)
So who were these strange characters you just played against?
COPYCAT:
Hello! I start with Cooperate, and afterwards, I just copy whatever you did in the last round. Meow
ALWAYS CHEAT:
the strong shall eat the weak
ALWAYS COOPERATE:
Let's be best friends! <3
GRUDGER:
Listen, pardner. I'll start cooperatin', and keep cooperatin',
but if y'all ever cheat me, I'LL CHEAT YOU BACK 'TIL THE END OF TARNATION.
DETECTIVE:
First: I analyze you. I start: Cooperate, Cheat, Cooperate, Cooperate.
If you cheat back, I'll act like
Copycat
.
If you never cheat back, I'll act like
Always Cheat
, to exploit you.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
Now, what if these characters were to play...
...against each other? →
It's tournament time!
Each character will now play against every other character:
that's 10 paired matches, and 10 rounds per match.
Who do you think will get the highest
total
score?
Think carefully about it... and then
PLACE YOUR BETS:
Alright, you placed your bet on [CHAR]!
Let's go through the matches one by one, and see how the tournament plays out...
first match →
next match →
Match #[N]:
[A] vs [B]

Total Scores:
[A] vs [B]
Oh, by the way...
...You may be skeptical about that Christmas Truce story about the World War I trenches.
Surely that was just a fluke?
Yes, the truce was dramatic, but it was
neither unique, nor unusual
.
Not
every
trench joined in the peace, but it was pretty widespread.
Many front-lines came up with the idea independently, and again:
despite
specific, strict orders not to.
And in fact, even
before
Christmas, several front-lines already
had
established an unofficial, secret peace.
They called it:
the "live and let live" system.
Basically, you don't shoot me, I don't shoot you. And this worked, in a lot of places!
You may still be skeptical. Most soldiers don't spontaneously form peace with the enemy.
What's so special about
trench
warfare?
Well, here's what's unique about the trenches:
unlike almost every other form of war,
you have to face the same
specific soldiers
every day.
It's a repeated game.
And that makes
all
the difference.
Anyway. And the winner is...
(drumroll please...) →
COPYCAT!
Congrats, you placed your bet on the right horse.
(Apologies to your bet, [CHAR].)
Copycat
goes by many names.
The Golden Rule, reciprocal altruism, tit for tat, or...
live and let live.
That's why "peace" could emerge in the trenches of World War I:
when you're forced to play the same game with the
same
specific people
(not just the same generic "enemy") over and over again --
Copycat
doesn't just win the battle, it wins the war.
But if things change a lot when you play multiple rounds of the same game, what if we play...
...multiple
tournaments?
→
Now, let's let our population of players
evolve over time
. It's a 3-step dance:
1. PLAY A TOURNAMENT
Let them all play against each other, and tally up their scores.
2. ELIMINATE LOSERS
Get rid of the 5 worst players. (if there's a tie, pick randomly between them)
3. REPRODUCE WINNERS
Clone the 5 best players. (if there's a tie, pick randomly between them)
...and REPEAT, for as long as you'd like.
Note: you don't have to wait for people to literally die & reproduce for culture to evolve --
all that's needed is that "unsuccessful" behaviors go away, and "successful" behaviors are imitated.
So now...
...let's see this in action. →
Say we start with the following population of players:
15 Always Cooperates
,
5 Always Cheats
, and
5 Copycats
.
(We'll ignore
Grudger
&
Detective
for now)
We're going to do the tournament-eliminate-reproduce dance a dozen times or so.
Let's make another bet! Who do you think will win the
first
tournament?
PLACE YOUR BETS, AGAIN:
Makes sense,
Always Cooperate
outnumbers everyone else right now...
Makes sense,
Always Cheat
has a lot of
Always Cooperates
to exploit...
Makes sense,
Copycat
won the tournament last time, why not again?...
Let's see if you're correct:
1) play tournament
2) eliminate bottom 5
3) reproduce top 5
Alas,
Always Cooperate
got eaten up by
Always Cheat
, whose numbers have now increased by 5.
Sadly, you were correct! The
Always Cheaters
won this time,
and their numbers increased by 5.
Alas,
Copycat
did not win – but at least they didn't do as bad
as
Always Cooperate
. They got eaten up by
Always Cheat
,
whose numbers have now increased by 5.
But let's try a few more rounds of this...
Always Cheat
is still growing,
at the expense of
Always Cooperate
...
And now, all the
Always Cooperates
are dead.
But, wait...
That's right: the
Always Cheats
became a victim of their own success!
They exploited the naive
Always Cooperators
,
but once they ran out of them, they had to face the
Copycats
:
who
are
nice, but not naive.
By simply copying the other player's moves,
Copycats
can play nice with each other,
while
Always Cheats
just cheat themselves!
Not only that, but it also means
Copycat
can give
Always Cheat
a taste of their own medicine.
And so, as a result...
...
Copycat
inherits the earth.
So, although your bet was off -- the nice-but-naive
Always Cooperators
were doomed from the start -- in the end, a
smart
form of niceness prevailed,
and the
Always Cheaters
were squashed.
So, in the short run you were right -
Always Cheat
won the first few rounds,
but in the end, its exploitativeness was its downfall.
So, in the long run, you were right -
Copycat
wins!
Always Cheat
may have won in the short run,
but its exploitativeness was its downfall.
This reminds me of a quote:
"We are punished by our sins, not for them."
~ Elbert Hubbard
(oh, and by the way...)
(...this result is similar even if we put
Grudger
&
Detective
back in:)
start the evolution process!
stop the evolution process
(Note: sometimes, a few
Grudgers
may stick around,
because when all players except
Grudger
&
Copycat
are eliminated, the two tie.)
So, it seems the math of game theory is telling us something:
that
Copycat's
philosophy,
"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you", may be not just a
moral
truth, but also a
mathematical
truth.
However...
...there's a problem: →
Look around. The world's full of total jerkwads.
If
Copycat
is the strategy in this repeated game of trust that's so powerful --
that even soldiers in World War I trenches independently "evolved" a similar strategy, called "live and let live" --
why, then, are there so many un-trusting, un-trustworthy people?
What's causing our epidemic of un-trust?
A clue's in that sentence itself. "In
this
repeated game of trust."
So far we've only talked about change in the players:
what about
a change in the game?
What could lead to...
...the evolution of
distrust?
Before everything goes to heck, let's start with something nice!
Here's a world filled entirely with
Always Cooperates
,
except for one
Always Cheat
and one
Copycat
.
Use the buttons on the right to
START
the sim,
go through it
step-by-step
, or
reset
it. →
As you already know,
Copycat
wins handily in the long run,
under our current rules!
But that's under our
current
rules, which say that
players play against each other for
10
rounds per match.
Does
Copycat
still win at 7 rounds? 5 rounds? 3? 2? 1?
Change the number of rounds
with the slider below,
then
START
the sim, and see what happens.
Feel free to experiment!
once you're done playing around, click:
As you saw, if you don't play enough rounds, (here: 5 or less)
ALWAYS CHEAT
dominates.
In 1985, when Americans were asked how many close friends they had,
the most common answer was "three". In 2004, the most common answer was
"zero"
.
We now have fewer friends across class, racial, economic, and political lines,
because we have fewer friends --
period.
And as you just discovered for yourself,
the fewer "repeat interactions" there are, the more distrust will spread.
(no, mass media doesn't count:
it must be
two-way
interactions between
specific individuals
.)
and oh, it gets worse... →
There's
another
way to breed distrust.
Here are the "payoffs" for the trust game:
With the normal payoffs,
Copycat
wins.
But now,
change the "both cooperate" reward from +2 to +1
,
then click
START
.
Even though +1 is still
more
than the punishment for both cheating (0)...
what happens?
feel free to play around with different payoffs!
once you're done, click:
(simulating: 10 rounds per match)
The same thing happens:
with a lower "win-win" reward,
Always Cheat
takes over.
Game theory has two powerful ideas about this:
"Zero-sum game".
This is the sadly common belief that a gain for "us"
must
come at a loss to "them", and vice versa.
"Non-zero-sum game".
This is when people make the hard effort
to create a win-win solution! (or at least, avoid a lose-lose)
Without the non-zero-sum game,
trust cannot evolve.
Speaking of which,
let's now look at our third & final barrier to the evolution of trust...
Misteaks
Mistakes. →
As cool as
Copycat
is, it has a huge, fatal weakness I haven't mentioned yet.
To understand the problem, let's say two
Copycats
are playing against each other:
Being "nice" players, both their first moves will be:
And normally, they'd just pay back each others' kindness and sing Kumbaya until the end of time.
But what if, while trying to reciprocate goodness...
OH NO
Mistakes, miscommunication, misinterpretations -- accidents happen all the time in real life.
But if the other person doesn't
think
it was an accident...
OH NO TIMES TWO
The other player, being a
Copycat
,
had
to retaliate...
...and you, being a
Copycat
as well, will
also
have to retaliate...
Thus, like the Hatfields and McCoys,
these two
Copycats
will spiral into an endless cycle of vengeance...
that started over a single mistake, long ago.
Tragic. But now, are there
other
types of players who can...
...deal with mistakes? →
Let's meet some new faces! (or, new hats, anyway)
COPYKITTEN:
Hello! I'm like
Copycat
,
except I Cheat back only after you Cheat me twice in a row.
After all, the first one could be a mistake! Purrrrr
SIMPLETON:
hi i try start cooperate.
if you cooperate back, i do
same thing
as last move, even if it mistake.
if you cheat back, i do
opposite thing
as last move, even if it mistake.
RANDOM:
Monkey robot! Ninja pizza tacos! lol i'm so random
(Just plays Cheat or Cooperate randomly with a 50/50 chance)
Alright, let's see how well these peeps do when they...
...play in a tournament →
Let's start with a dozen
Always Cooperates
,
versus our old winner, the fair
Copycat
,
and our three new characters:
the forgiving
Copykitten
,
the dull
Simpleton
, and
the silly
Random
.
In each round of a match, players have a small chance of making a mistake. (let's say, 5%)
Who do you think will come out on top?
Think carefully, then PLACE YOUR BETS:
Alright, you bet [CHAR] wins. Let's find out!
Use the controls to your left to
START
the sim in quick mode,
or go through it
step-by-step
.
You were correct --
Your bet was close, but no cigar --
Simpleton
wins!
This is because
Simpleton
is actually capable of
exploiting
Always Cooperate
. They both start cooperating,
but if
Simpleton
makes a mistake and cheats,
since
Always Cooperate
never retaliates,
it'll keep cheating them
.
Now let's try...
...the same thing as before, except instead of half-
Always Cooperate
,
it's half-
Always Cheat
. It's a much
less
forgiving,
more
hostile environment.
Who do you think will win now?
Think, then PLACE YOUR BETS:
You bet on [CHAR]. Again, go through the simulation...
You were right on the money --
Good guess, but someone else took the prize --
Copykitten
wins this time!
That's surprising that with an even
meaner
starting population,
Copykitten
,
a
more forgiving
version of
Copycat
,
was the most successful! (note:
Copykitten
is so forgiving
it doesn't even
entirely
wipe out
Copycat
. it shares room)
In this case, a bit of "miscommunication" (5% chance of mistake each round) could lead
to more
forgiveness
. But is this true for
all
levels...
...of miscommunication?
Use the slider below to change the amount of "miscommunication", then hit START.
At 5%,
Copykitten
wins.
What happens at 0%? Or 20%? Or 50%? (it only goes up to 50%,
because at that point,
every
move is a coin flip)
When you're done playing around, click:
The results turn out something like this:
At 0%,
the fair
Copycat
wins!
At 1% to 9%,
the forgiving
Copykitten
wins!
At 10% to 49%:
the unfair, unforgiving
Always Cheat
wins.
At 50%,
nobody wins ever.
This is why "miscommunication" is such an interesting barrier to trust:
a
little
bit of it leads to forgiveness,
but
too much
and it leads to widespread distrust!
I think our modern media technology,
as much as it's helped us increase communication...
has increased our
miscommunication
much more.
At last, let's experiment with
all
the numbers, the knobs and sliders.
Let's play...
...in the Sandbox Mode!
Start off with this distribution of players:
The payoffs in a one-on-one game are:
set default
Play [N] rounds per match:
Play [N] round per match:
After each tournament, eliminate the bottom [N] players & reproduce the top [N] players:
After each tournament, eliminate the bottom [N] player & reproduce the top [N] player:
During each round, there's a [N]% chance a player makes a mistake:
NOTE: Sandbox Mode is totally optional.
Feel free to skip it, or play around! Once you're done, let's recap...
what we learnt today! →
Game theory has shown us the three things we need for the evolution of trust:
1. REPEAT INTERACTIONS
Trust keeps a relationship going,
but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions
before
trust can evolve.
2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS
You must be playing a non-zero-sum game,
a game where it's at least possible that
both
players can be better off -- a win-win.
3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION
If the level of miscommunication is
too
high, trust breaks down.
But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be
more
forgiving.
Of course, real-world trust is affected by much more than this.
There's reputation, shared values, contracts, cultural markers, blah blah blah.
And let's not forget...
...the
biggest
lesson. →
If there's one big takeaway
from
all
of game theory, it's this:
What the game is, defines what the players do.
Our problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,
it's that our
environment
acts against the evolution of trust.
That may seem cynical or naive -- that we're "merely" products of our environment --
but as game theory reminds us, we
are
each others' environment.
In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run,
it's us players who define the game.
So, do what
you
can do, to create the conditions necessary to evolve trust.
Build relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly.
Maybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches,
cross No Man's Land to come together...
and all learn...
...to live and let live.
